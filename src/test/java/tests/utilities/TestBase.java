  /*
        TestBase Class:
        We create this class to avoid repeating the same setup and teardown code
        in every test class. It uses Java’s OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) concept
        of inheritance.

        Key points:

        Reusability:
        Any class that extends TestBase automatically gets access to the driver,
        setup(), and teardown() methods.
        Child classes don’t need to write these methods again.

        Access Modifier:
        TestBase is usually placed in a separate package.
        To allow child classes to use the driver, it must be declared
        as public or protected.
        We choose "protected" since only child classes need it, not external classes.

        Abstract Class:
        We don’t want anyone to create objects of TestBase directly.
        To prevent this, we declare TestBase as abstract.
        Abstract classes can’t be instantiated; they can only be inherited.

        Usage:
        We will extend TestBase in our test classes.
        The driver variable and common methods are inherited,
        which keeps our code shorter, cleaner, and easier to maintain.

    }

    @AfterEach
    void tearDown() {
        driver.quit();
